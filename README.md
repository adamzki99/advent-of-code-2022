# advent-of-code-2022
This is my first year of participating in the Advent of Code. I will be using this as a oppertunity to learn about the GO programming language.
In this read me I will keep a list of "Lessons learned" for each day of the event (Hopefully so that I can reflect on my progress on the 25th).

## Lessons learned

### Day 1

Today I learnt many things, but most importantly of what the ":" does when trying to use variables, see the following snippet.

```go
myVariable := 1 //Initilization

myVariable = 2 //Usage
```

Also that VSCode deletes any un-used imports when saving. Something that I found very annoying as I am always hitting the "ctrl + s" combo.

It is also good to track how I create my "projects/modules", see the following snippet.
```bash
go mod init parrentFolder/currentFolder
```
